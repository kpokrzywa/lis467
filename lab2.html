  <h3>Just Keep Zooming</h3>
  <p>Since the content here doesn't really matter, I thought I would take the opportunity to remind everyone that Zoomquilt gifs exist and <a href="https://zoomquilt.org/">they</a> <a href="https://zoomquilt2.com/">are</a> <a href="https://arkadia.xyz/">entertaining!</a></p>
  <p>The original Zoomquilt was released in 2004. I've linked to a few of the follow-up projects as well! They're fun, they're weird, they'll put you into a trance. Enjoy!</p>
